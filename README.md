JSJ 352 Sum up with me baz a coding newbie

This episode I really good, learnt more on CSS and that it has only so much power until you 
need to use js or something other. Power I am meaning as in doing calculations and other bits & bobs.



Some key words I picked up is : events , element ,


I also picked up was that CSS has properties and js can create properties for CSS.
also known as CSS Varibles.

The convo was good, the voices were plesant to listen to. Speech was at a good speed so
I could pick up kinda what was going on and being said.
